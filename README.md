# Gutenberg Examples

Welcome to the `gutenberg-examples-2023` repo on GitHub. Here you can find a bunch of block and non-block examples for Gutenberg that you can use to learn about Block Development and other related Gutenberg topics.

Every example is contained in a plugin so to see an example in action the related plugin needs to be installed and activated in a WordPress installation.

> **Note**
> Check the [List of examples](#list-of-examples) below. To see a [playground](https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/)-powered live demo of each example click on their Live Demo icon ![](/wordpress-juanmaguitar/gutenberg-examples-2023/raw/trunk/assets/icon-wp.svg).


## Getting Started

This `gutenberg-examples-2023` repo is a monorepo multipackage because it contains several packages (plugins) and is prepared to manage them collectively. To get up and running with it, you will need to make sure that you have installed the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) - While you can always install Node through other means, we recommend using NVM to ensure you're aligned with the version used by our development teams. Our repository contains [an `.nvmrc` file](.nvmrc) which helps ensure you are using the correct version of Node.
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) - This monorepo utilizes PNPM to manage project dependencies and run various scripts involved in building and testing projects. You can easily install it with `npm i -g pnpm`.

### Quick Start Guide

After [cloning this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and entering into this projects's folder (`cd gutenberg-examples-2023`), do the following from the root of the project:

```bash
# Set your Node version to the right one for this project (as defined on .nvmrc)
nvm use
# Install the dependencies for all of the plugins
pnpm install
# Launch a build process for all of the plugins in the monorepo
pnpm run build
```

At this point you are now ready to begin developing and testing the examples.

### See the examples in action

To see the examples in action you have the following options:

- Click on the Live Demo icon ![](/wordpress-juanmaguitar/gutenberg-examples-2023/raw/trunk/assets/icon-wp.svg) (from the [List of examples](#list-of-examples) table below) to see a [playground](https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/)-powered live demo of the example.
- Use your own WordPress installation to install the plugin (that can be downloaded as a `.zip` from the 📦 icon of the example you're interested in the [List of examples](#list-of-examples) table below).
- Run `npm run env:start` from the root folder to use [`wp-env`](DEVELOPMENT.md##wordpress-local-development-environment) to get a local development environment with ALL the examples (each example can be located by their ID)
- Run `pnpm -- wp-env start` from any plugin folder to use [`wp-env`](DEVELOPMENT.md##wordpress-local-development-environment) to get a local development environment with that example
- Run `npx @wp-now/wp-now start` from any plugin folder to use [`wp-now`](https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/tree/trunk/packages/wp-now) to quickly launch a WordPress installation with that specific plugin installed.
- Copy the plugins folders for the examples you're interested in under the `plugins` folder of your own WordPress installation.

## List of Examples

The folder [**`plugins`**](plugins) contains all the plugins that register each one of the gutenberg examples (block and non-block examples). Each example has a unique ID that can be used to filter or find them.

The examples in this repo are listed in the following table:

- Each example **ID** links to its related folder.
- Each one the **tags** assigned to each example, links to their description in the [Tags](#tags) section below.

<details>
  <summary>Most of the examples in this repo are blocks for the Block Editor and their code use <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/javascript/esnext-js/">ESNext</a> + <a href="https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a> Syntax (as it's a general recommendation)</summary>
<br>  
<p><em>Most of the examples in this repo showcase a specific type of block that can be used in the Block Editor. Those examples that doesn't specifically register a block for the Block Editor are labelled with the tag <code>NO-BLOCK</code>.</em></p>

<p><em>The examples using <code>ESNext</code> or <code>JSX</code> needs to run a <a href="https://github.com/wordpress-juanmaguitar/gutenberg-examples-2023/blob/trunk/DEVELOPMENT.md#build-process">Build process</a> to get the final version of the block ready to use.</em></p>


<p><em>There are some examples in this repo that doesn't use ESNext or JSX Syntax so they don't need to run   any build process. These examples are labelled with the tag <code>NO-BUILD</code>.</em></p>
